# Implemented What i have learned Made a Redux store in which we can add item delete item and update the quantity and get the correct price for the items.
 Used React Redux, Redux ToolKit , For Styling i have used SCSS. I have used SCSS it makes codes look easy and optimized and minimilistic.
# Also made it responsive.
# I haven't got into much styling.
For no reason i don't know why i am not geeting the value of quantity on the screen though it is increasing and showing in the console log.Maybe somewhere the value of the color is white ðŸ˜‚ðŸ˜‚.
Feel Free is to respond to that error and let me kknow the line number and the value.
